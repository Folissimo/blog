Summary: Favicons are the tiny images that appear in the browser tab. You can customise them with Folissimo and it's worth it!

Favicons are the tiny icons that appear in the browser tab when you're viewing your website.

We recommend that you upload your own because this will make your site stand out in people's history and bookmarks.

The default is the Folissimo logo, but you can upload your own image within the "preferences":

* Click on "preferences", then click on the "logo" tab
* Select "upload your own favicon"
* Choose any image, but if you upload an image which is 16x16 pixels it'll be really sharp
