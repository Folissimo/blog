Summary: It's not just the look that's changed, we've also made a number of improvements to productivity

To coincide with the launch of [our new frontpage](http://www.folissimo.com), we've changed the look
of the administration system. We're hoping that it's made it easier to find your way about. 
*If it hasn't let us know (support@folissimo.com).*

More importantly, we've added a number of new features that give you more control over
your content and reduce the amount of time you have to spend updating your site:

###Font Customisation

Although we try hard to make sure that our curated font selections fit the bill,
you may find that you want something a bit different: maybe you want a larger menu font,
maybe you want your site title in UPPERCASE, maybe you want a completely different font
for body text.

You can now choose "custom font" from the font list. Click "edit" and then experiment
with the different fonts.

On most themes, "Primary Fonts" correspond to site titles and post headers, "secondary" to menus and subheadings
and "tertiary" is the body text such as "text item" content and image descriptions.

###Custom Backgrounds

On selected themes, it's now possible to upload your own background. This could be a repeating 
texture like a wood pattern, or it could be a large image.

To upload your own image, under the "colour" section in the Theme Editor, select "custom background" from
the "Background" drop-down and then click "edit".

You will be able to upload a new background image. Once uploaded you can choose "tiled" to make it repeat across
your background or "centered" for it to be stretched across the screen.

###Workflow Improvements


![Multiple Selecting](/static/images/workflow.jpg)

We heard how you have found it difficult to edit a lot of images simultaneously. 
As a result weâ€™ve added more ways to edit your images:
+	right click on any item to open it in its respective editor
+	hold down shift and click on the content title to multiple select /deselect items
+	drag a box over the content to multiple select
+	edit all selected images by clicking on any title or right clicking on the image

*As ever, please drop us an email : support@folissimo.com or use our twitter or facebook if you have any questions!*
