Summary: What's behind our new site design and why we scrapped the old one 

Although we liked the previous design, it just wasn't doing the business:

An embarrasingly small number of users were scrolling down the front page
to see the detailed explanation of Folissimo and many people were going 
away without understanding what Folissimo does: a total UX failure!

###Back to the drawing-board

So we went away and thought about how we could simplify the proposition on the landing page,
show off our themes as best we can and explain how great we think our administration
system is.

We were initially going to go for some really fancy parallax-animating backgrounds, but
we were finding it hard to keep them smooth with all the images and textures on the page.

We decided it was really important to keep people focussed on the key points:

*	the themes
*	how you can customise them
*	the admin section
*	signing up

We settled on big alternating white and black strips, keeping the torn edge that we used in 
our first design and making the most of the wonderful jQuery [Flexslider](https://github.com/woothemes/flexslider) plugin to move content
horizontally across each strip.

Having got fairly happy with the new frontpage, we now had to look at the admin section which
badly needed some designing!

###Back to the back-end

We had initially thought that the backend would be a 2-minute job, but it ended up taking a good
few days of experimentation with almost every colour combination imaginable before we ended up with something
that both matched the new landing page design and was also attractive and functional.

As is so often the case with design, it took a few days of adding unending amount of details to realise
that it was best being stripped down to the bare minimum.

So there we have it: a new look and a new(er) Folissimo.

Let us know what you think!
