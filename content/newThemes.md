Summary: We've just released 3 great new themes...

We've just released 3 great new themes:

####Caramba

Caramba is a beautiful theme, great for video and project-based creative professionals.

The front page is a large splash page with a subtle menu and the subsidiary pages cascade
image previews at the bottom of each page with one, large focal image at the top.

See [Our preview here](http://mrscissors.folissimo.com)

####Villalobos

Villalobos is a minimal theme designed for photographers who want their work full-screen.

The nuts and bolts of the site such as your contact details, site description and menu is all
concealed at the bottom, sliding up when clicked on.

Fine art photographer [Peter Knight](http://peterknight.folissimo.com) is using the theme beautifully.

####In The Air

In The Air was designed for people that wanted to make use of the new custom background feature.

Content is positioned vertically  and overlays a fixed background image. This is great if you want
flexibility in the type of content you display and might be ideal if you need to mix soundcloud embeds
in with your photos or videos.
