&lt;p&gt;To try out a splash screen for your site:
&lt;em&gt; click on the "Customise Theme" button to open the Theme Editor
&lt;/em&gt; tick the 'splash' box on the top right&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to customise the position and colour of your splash screen, click on the new tab "Splash" at the top then edit the available options.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Tips"></category><category term="Using Folissimo"></category><category term="Splash"></category></entry><entry><title>How favicons can personalise your site</title><link href="http://blog.folissimo.com/logo-and-favicon.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-02-06T09:30:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Campbell Morgan</name></author><id>tag:blog.folissimo.com,2013-02-06:logo-and-favicon.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Favicons are the tiny icons that appear in the browser tab when you're viewing your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend that you upload your own because this will make your site stand out in people's history and bookmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default is the Folissimo logo, but you can upload your own image within the "preferences":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on "preferences", then click on the "logo" tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select "upload your own favicon"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose any image, but if you upload an image which is 16x16 pixels it'll be really sharp&lt;/li&gt;

If you’re not used to thinking about fonts, here are some tips to help improve style and readability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep it simple: if you’re planning to use more than 2 fonts, make sure you’re confidently going for a particular style because a lot of fonts can make a site messy and hard to navigate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vary headings &amp;amp; body text: make sure there is a clear difference between headings and the body of your text. This can be achieved in a number of ways:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternate between a serif font (eg Times, Garamond, Georgia etc) and a sans-serif font (Arial, Helvetica, Tahoma etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt; bold &lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;italic&lt;/em&gt; to emphasise differences: eg set a heading in bold, then the body in italic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put headings in UPPERCASE to contrast with the body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take control of font sizes by making the heading much larger than the body text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure body text is legible: complex fonts can be great for very large header fonts, but can often be very difficult to read at normal text size. Make sure you use clear, well-spaced fonts whenever you want your audience to read more than a sentence of text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep an eye on current trends: every time you see some typography that you like, ask yourself why you like it and look at the details. Is it a nice font or a nice combination of fonts? Trends change fast, so you need to pay attention to keep up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Customising your fonts on Folissimo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each theme on Folissimo has a range of curated fonts, selected by the Folissimo team. If however, you would something more personal, then choose the “custom font” option from the fonts menu in the “Theme Editor” and then click “edit”. You will then be able to change the font, size, style and weight for your heading, menu and body text.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Tips"></category><category term="Typography"></category><category term="Admin"></category></entry><entry><title>Tracking your Users with Google Analytics</title><link href="http://blog.folissimo.com/track-with-google-analytics.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-17T09:30:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Campbell Morgan</name></author><id>tag:blog.folissimo.com,2013-01-17:track-with-google-analytics.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Knowing what your audience wants is really important to building and maintaining a successful website. You may think that you have a good idea what your most impressive work is, but you never know until you see the stats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see detailed information on who visits your site, where they come from, how long they stay on your site and a whole host of other information, then we highly recommend you link Google Analytics to your Folissimo page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;How to do it:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an account at &lt;a href="www.google.com/analytics/"&gt;www.google.com/analytics/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new property using your Folissimo address (ie www.yoursite.com or yoursite.folissimo.com)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your new property will have an id - something like UA-XXXXXXXX-X where X is a number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log in to the admin section (admin.folissimo.com) and click on “Preferences” then click on the “Search” tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paste your property id into the “Google Analytics” field and press save.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit your site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within 24 hours Google Analytics you will start getting detailed information on your site&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Tips"></category><category term="Using Folissimo"></category><category term="Google Analytics"></category></entry><entry><title>Understanding Search Engines</title><link href="http://blog.folissimo.com/understanding-search-engines.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-16T13:30:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Campbell Morgan</name></author><id>tag:blog.folissimo.com,2013-01-16:understanding-search-engines.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you search for your name or business, you may be lucky enough to occupy the top spot at google, but if you’re not, you might be frustrated, wondering why whoever has made it to the top deserves that place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand why, It helps to understand how Google and other major search engines (such as Microsoft’s Bing) rank their pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to say is that the precise details of how each search engine categorises content is a &lt;em&gt;commercial secret&lt;/em&gt; to ensure that nobody is able to successfully “game” the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, having a rough idea of how it works should help your page rank. At its simplest, search engines gauge both the quality and relevance of the results using a combination of the content on your page, the “meta description” (more on that later) and most importantly, the pages which link through to your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tips:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that you describe your work accurately and concisely using words that people are likely to search for eg: “John Smith, a North London sculptor working primarily with copper and found objects” is much better than “John Smith, artist working with 3d”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a concise “meta description”  (found under the “search” tab in the preferences) describing your site in less than 30-40 words. The meta description is some text which is included in every one of your pages, but is only visible to computers. Google usually use this to form the description of your page in their results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourage as many people as possible to link to your site every time they mention you online, but make sure that the links are used relevantly rather than haphazardly: if google sense that you are paying people to link to your site, they will ban you!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try and get your site linked from sites which are well-respected and from sites with a lot of traffic : being linked from the Tate Gallery or an academic at UCL will increase your rankings far more than appearing on your friend’s Tumblr page.&lt;/li&gt;

of the administration system. We're hoping that it's made it easier to find your way about.
&lt;em&gt;If it hasn't let us know (support@folissimo.com).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, we've added a number of new features that give you more control over
your content and reduce the amount of time you have to spend updating your site:
&lt;a id="customisefonts" name="customisefonts"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Font Customisation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Customising Fonts" src="/images/fontCustomisation.jpg" title="Customising Fonts" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we try hard to make sure that our curated font selections fit the bill,
you may find that you want something a bit different: maybe you want a larger menu font,
maybe you want your site title in UPPERCASE, maybe you want a completely different font
for body text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now choose "custom font" from the font list. Click "edit" and then experiment
with the different fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On most themes, "Primary Fonts" correspond to site titles and post headers, "secondary" to menus and subheadings
and "tertiary" is the body text such as "text item" content and image descriptions.
&lt;a id="backgrounds" name="backgrounds"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Custom Backgrounds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Customising Backgrounds" src="/images/backgroundCustomisation.jpg" title="Customising Backgrounds" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On selected themes, it's now possible to upload your own background. This could be a repeating
texture like a wood pattern, or it could be a large image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To upload your own image, under the "colour" section in the Theme Editor, select "custom background" from
the "Background" drop-down and then click "edit".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be able to upload a new background image. Once uploaded you can choose "tiled" to make it repeat across
your background or "centered" for it to be stretched across the screen.
&lt;a id="workflow" name="workflow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Workflow Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Multiple Selecting" src="/images/workflow.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We heard how you have found it difficult to edit a lot of images simultaneously.
As a result we’ve added more ways to edit your images:
+   right click on any item to open it in its respective editor
+   hold down shift and click on the content title to multiple select /deselect items
+   drag a box over the content to multiple select
+   edit all selected images by clicking on any title or right clicking on the image&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As ever, please drop us an email : support@folissimo.com or use our twitter or facebook if you have any questions!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Site"></category><category term="Alterations"></category><category term="Admin"></category></entry><entry><title>Folissimo Site Redesign</title><link href="http://blog.folissimo.com/site-redesign.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-16T09:30:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Campbell Morgan</name></author><id>tag:blog.folissimo.com,2013-01-16:site-redesign.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Although we liked the previous design, it just wasn't doing the business:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An embarrasingly small number of users were scrolling down the front page
to see the detailed explanation of Folissimo and many people were going
away without understanding what Folissimo does: a total UX failure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Back to the drawing-board&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we went away and thought about how we could simplify the proposition on the landing page,
show off our themes as best we can and explain how great we think our administration
system is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were initially going to go for some really fancy parallax-animating backgrounds, but
we were finding it hard to keep them smooth with all the images and textures on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided it was really important to keep people focussed on the key points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the themes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how you can customise them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the admin section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;signing up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We settled on big alternating white and black strips, keeping the torn edge that we used in
our first design and making the most of the wonderful jQuery &lt;a href="https://github.com/woothemes/flexslider"&gt;Flexslider&lt;/a&gt; plugin to move content
horizontally across each strip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having got fairly happy with the new frontpage, we now had to look at the admin section which
badly needed some designing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Back to the back-end&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had initially thought that the backend would be a 2-minute job, but it ended up taking a good
few days of experimentation with almost every colour combination imaginable before we ended up with something
that both matched the new landing page design and was also attractive and functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is so often the case with design, it took a few days of adding unending amount of details to realise
that it was best being stripped down to the bare minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there we have it: a new look and a new(er) Folissimo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Site"></category><category term="Alterations"></category><category term="UX"></category></entry><entry><title>3 New Themes</title><link href="http://blog.folissimo.com/new-themes.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Campbell Morgan</name></author><id>tag:blog.folissimo.com,2013-01-14:new-themes.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've just released 3 great new themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Caramba&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caramba is a beautiful theme, great for video and project-based creative professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front page is a large splash page with a subtle menu and the subsidiary pages cascade
image previews at the bottom of each page with one, large focal image at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="http://mrscissors.folissimo.com"&gt;Our preview here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Villalobos&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Villalobos is a minimal theme designed for photographers who want their work full-screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nuts and bolts of the site such as your contact details, site description and menu is all
concealed at the bottom, sliding up when clicked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine art photographer &lt;a href="http://peterknight.folissimo.com"&gt;Peter Knight&lt;/a&gt; is using the theme beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;In The Air&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Air was designed for people that wanted to make use of the new custom background feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content is positioned vertically  and overlays a fixed background image. This is great if you want
flexibility in the type of content you display and might be ideal if you need to mix soundcloud embeds
in with your photos or videos.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Site"></category><category term="Alterations"></category><category term="Themes"></category></entry></feed>
