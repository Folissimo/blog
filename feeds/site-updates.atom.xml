of the administration system. We're hoping that it's made it easier to find your way about.
&lt;em&gt;If it hasn't let us know (support@folissimo.com).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, we've added a number of new features that give you more control over
your content and reduce the amount of time you have to spend updating your site:
&lt;a id="customisefonts" name="customisefonts"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Font Customisation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Customising Fonts" src="/images/fontCustomisation.jpg" title="Customising Fonts" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we try hard to make sure that our curated font selections fit the bill,
you may find that you want something a bit different: maybe you want a larger menu font,
maybe you want your site title in UPPERCASE, maybe you want a completely different font
for body text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now choose "custom font" from the font list. Click "edit" and then experiment
with the different fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On most themes, "Primary Fonts" correspond to site titles and post headers, "secondary" to menus and subheadings
and "tertiary" is the body text such as "text item" content and image descriptions.
&lt;a id="backgrounds" name="backgrounds"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Custom Backgrounds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Customising Backgrounds" src="/images/backgroundCustomisation.jpg" title="Customising Backgrounds" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On selected themes, it's now possible to upload your own background. This could be a repeating
texture like a wood pattern, or it could be a large image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To upload your own image, under the "colour" section in the Theme Editor, select "custom background" from
the "Background" drop-down and then click "edit".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be able to upload a new background image. Once uploaded you can choose "tiled" to make it repeat across
your background or "centered" for it to be stretched across the screen.
&lt;a id="workflow" name="workflow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Workflow Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Multiple Selecting" src="/images/workflow.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We heard how you have found it difficult to edit a lot of images simultaneously.
As a result weâ€™ve added more ways to edit your images:
+   right click on any item to open it in its respective editor
+   hold down shift and click on the content title to multiple select /deselect items
+   drag a box over the content to multiple select
+   edit all selected images by clicking on any title or right clicking on the image&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As ever, please drop us an email : support@folissimo.com or use our twitter or facebook if you have any questions!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Site"></category><category term="Alterations"></category><category term="Admin"></category></entry><entry><title>Folissimo Site Redesign</title><link href="http://blog.folissimo.com/site-redesign.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-16T09:30:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Campbell Morgan</name></author><id>tag:blog.folissimo.com,2013-01-16:site-redesign.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Although we liked the previous design, it just wasn't doing the business:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An embarrasingly small number of users were scrolling down the front page
to see the detailed explanation of Folissimo and many people were going
away without understanding what Folissimo does: a total UX failure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Back to the drawing-board&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we went away and thought about how we could simplify the proposition on the landing page,
show off our themes as best we can and explain how great we think our administration
system is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were initially going to go for some really fancy parallax-animating backgrounds, but
we were finding it hard to keep them smooth with all the images and textures on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided it was really important to keep people focussed on the key points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the themes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how you can customise them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the admin section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;signing up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We settled on big alternating white and black strips, keeping the torn edge that we used in
our first design and making the most of the wonderful jQuery &lt;a href="https://github.com/woothemes/flexslider"&gt;Flexslider&lt;/a&gt; plugin to move content
horizontally across each strip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having got fairly happy with the new frontpage, we now had to look at the admin section which
badly needed some designing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Back to the back-end&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had initially thought that the backend would be a 2-minute job, but it ended up taking a good
few days of experimentation with almost every colour combination imaginable before we ended up with something
that both matched the new landing page design and was also attractive and functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is so often the case with design, it took a few days of adding unending amount of details to realise
that it was best being stripped down to the bare minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there we have it: a new look and a new(er) Folissimo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Site"></category><category term="Alterations"></category><category term="UX"></category></entry><entry><title>3 New Themes</title><link href="http://blog.folissimo.com/new-themes.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Campbell Morgan</name></author><id>tag:blog.folissimo.com,2013-01-14:new-themes.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've just released 3 great new themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Caramba&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caramba is a beautiful theme, great for video and project-based creative professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front page is a large splash page with a subtle menu and the subsidiary pages cascade
image previews at the bottom of each page with one, large focal image at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="http://mrscissors.folissimo.com"&gt;Our preview here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Villalobos&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Villalobos is a minimal theme designed for photographers who want their work full-screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nuts and bolts of the site such as your contact details, site description and menu is all
concealed at the bottom, sliding up when clicked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine art photographer &lt;a href="http://peterknight.folissimo.com"&gt;Peter Knight&lt;/a&gt; is using the theme beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;In The Air&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Air was designed for people that wanted to make use of the new custom background feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content is positioned vertically  and overlays a fixed background image. This is great if you want
flexibility in the type of content you display and might be ideal if you need to mix soundcloud embeds
in with your photos or videos.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Site"></category><category term="Alterations"></category><category term="Themes"></category></entry></feed>
